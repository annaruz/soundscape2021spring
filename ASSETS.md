|  Santa | My voice edited to be deeper or my dad if I can convince him to help me; will need voice as well as breathing or other noises to sound as though it's really Santa wearing a microphone   |
|  Mrs. Claus | My voice or my mom's voice in a quick convo with Santa   |
|  Elves | My voice edited to be higher; many recordings for lots of elves who are working in the workshop  |
|  Microphone | Voice Memos on iPhone or a more high-tech app   |
|  Audio editing program | Audacity   |

|  Setting | Will need to find sounds of footprints through the snow; sounds of hammering  | |
|  Background music | find an online free sound that sounds Christmassy; also look for jingle bell sounds that I *may* be able to record on my own   |
