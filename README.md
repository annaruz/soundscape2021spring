This is a project for my Composing Digital Media course! With this first project (and my first time using Audacity), I have created a soundscape of the Santa's Workshop called "Another Day in the Workshop." This soundscape narrative puts you right in the chaos of the North Pole during February. It is a work in progress, and it has been a great learning experience!
